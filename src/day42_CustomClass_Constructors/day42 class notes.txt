Constructor: special method

this: refers to the object instances
	this. : to call instance variable & instane method
	this(): used for calling the constructor


constructor call:
			1. constructor cannot be called by its name (this() need to be used)
			2. only a constructor can call another constructor
			3. Constructor call MUST be at the first step
			4. one constructor cannot call more than one constructor
			5. Constructor cannot call itself or contain itself
