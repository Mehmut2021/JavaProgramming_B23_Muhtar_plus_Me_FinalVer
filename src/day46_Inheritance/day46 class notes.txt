Warmup tasks:
	carTask:
		Create a class called Car
			instance variables:
				brand, model, year, price, color, miles

				add a constructor to set all the fields

			instance methods:
				start(), drive(),toString()

		Create the following sub classes of Car:
			1. Toyota:
					extra methods:
							reliabile()
			2. BMW:
					extra methods:
						breaksDown()
						race()
			3. Tesla:
					extra methods:
						autoPilot();


	shapeTask
		1. create a class called Shape
						vairables: name, isShape(boolean), hasArea(boolean), hasPerimeter(boolean)

						add a constructor that can set all the fields

						methods: calcArea(), calcPerimeter(), 
								 toString(): returns the name, area and perimeter that are returned by calcArea(), calcPerimeter()

		2. create sub classes of Shape:
						Circle
						Rectangle
						Square

			 give the instance variables that are needed to calculate the Area, perimeter, of those shapes


	AFTER TODAY'S TOPIC: Overriding
		3. override super class' calculateArea(), calculatePerimeter() methods to the sub classes:

		 		Area of the circle:    3.14 * radius * radius
		 		Area of the rectangle:  width * length
		 		Area of the square:    side * side

		 		Perimeter of circle:   3.14 * 2 * radius
		 		Perimeter of rectangle: (width + length) * 2
		 		Perimeter of Square: 4 * side



Inheritance:
		A parent class can have multiple child classes
		A child class can have one parent class
